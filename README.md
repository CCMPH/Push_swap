# Push_swap

The challenge of this 42 project was to efficiently sort a random list of integers using 2 stacks and a limited set of operations. 
The aim of this project is to introduce you to sorting algorithms and how to optimize them.

Due to this project I gain a lot more insight in the use of an linked list and Memory management.
